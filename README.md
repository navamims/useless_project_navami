### Project Description
Plan Today, Delay Forever is a satirical timetable generatorthat turns your productivity dreams into hilariously realistic  chaos.
Designed with a playful tone , this web software lets users input tasks thay think the'll do -and then cleverly replaces their dream plans with funny,brutaly honest "real life" alternatives.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The website solves the emotional disconnect between ideal planning and actual behavior by making you laugh about it- instead of feeling gulty.
Usually , We create perfect schedules that fails. At the same time The website mocks perfection with funny,honest timeslots'
We don't track what we actually do, whereas the website  reflects reality with sass in a way that's relatable.
 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Through the "PLAN TODAY DELAY FOREVER" we're solving the core issue that  people usually create idealistic daily schedules that they don't folllow , leading to frustruation , guilt, and unrealistic expressions.It normalises failures to follow prefect plans.It replays guilt with humour.
